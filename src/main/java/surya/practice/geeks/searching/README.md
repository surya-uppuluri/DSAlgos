 |S.No| Problem | Difficulty | Solved | NeedRevision?  | Comments/Algorithm used  |
 |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | Basic Binary Search | Very Easy | Yes | No |**Use 2 pointer approach in [Iteration](BinarySearch.java#L9)** When the input is sorted, you can search by repeatedly narrowing down the search range. Compare and keep going accordingly. If no element is found before the pointers cross each other, you don't have the element under search in your input list. **[Recursion](BinarySearch.java#L30-L40) is plain intuitive** |
