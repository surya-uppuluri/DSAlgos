## Searching

WIP


 |S.No| Problem | Difficulty | Solved | NeedRevision?  | Comments/Algorithm used  |
 |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | Basic Binary Search | Basic | Yes | No | When the input is sorted, you can search by repeatedly narrowing down the search range. Compare and keep going accordingly. If no element is found before the pointers cross each other, you don't have the element under search in your input list. **Use 2 pointer approach in [Iteration](BinarySearch.java#L9)**. **[Recursion](BinarySearch.java#L30-L40) is plain intuitive** |
  | 2| [CountOnesInBinaryArray](CountOnesInBinaryArray.java#L5-L63) | Easy | Yes | No | Corner case is tricky. What if the input contains all 1s? Think of corner cases always.|
