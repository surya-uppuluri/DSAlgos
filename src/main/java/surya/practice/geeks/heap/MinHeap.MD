## Min Heap

1. A variation of [Complete Binary Tree](../tree/TypesOfBinaryTrees.MD#L62) in which the value in each internal node <= values in the children of that node.
2. When represented as an array, if a node is stored a index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.

### Example1:

            5             
         /      \         
       10        15       
      /                   
    30                    

### Example2:

         13
      /       \  
    16         31 
    /  \        /  \
    41    51    100   41

#### Representation

Typically represented as an array. The root element will be at Arr(0). For any ith node, i.e., Arr(i):


    Arr[(i -1) / 2] returns its parent node.
    Arr[(2 * i) + 1] returns its left child node.
    Arr[(2 * i) + 2] returns its right child node.

#### Operations on Min Heap:

    getMin(): It returns the root element of Min Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
    extractMin(): Removes the minimum element from MinHeap. 
                  Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Log n)
                  This operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.
    insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. 
               We add a new key at the end of the tree. If new key is larger than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. 
               Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.

### Heap vs BST

**Summary**

|  Operation  | Type   |  BST  |  Heap  |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Insert   | average |  log(n) |   1|
|Insert  |  worst   |  log(n)  |  log(n) or n|
|Find any | worst    | log(n)   | n|
|Find max  |worst     |1 (**)   | 1|
|Create    |worst     |n log(n) | n|
|Delete    |worst     |log(n)   | log(n)|

All average times on this table are the same as their worst times except for Insert.
